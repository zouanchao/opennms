_{opennms-product-name}_ uses the database to maintain the current state of alarms.
By default, these are deleted sometime after they are cleared, or if they remain without any activity for a long period of time.

The _Alarm History API_ was developed to help retain the state of alarms over time.

The historical data is stored in _Elasticsearch_.
